## What is HTML?

- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content
- Consists of elements
- opening and closing tags

### Marking up text

- Headings use `<h1>` etc

- Paragraphs use `<p>`

- Unordered lists `<u1>` and ordered lists `<o1>`

- links use `<a>`

# Semantics

- In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code -- for example, 'what purpose does that HTML element have?'
- an HTML `<h1>` element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role of a top level heading on your page.
