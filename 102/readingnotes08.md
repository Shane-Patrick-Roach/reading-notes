# Operators and Loops

## Loops

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
- Think of a loop as a computerized version of the game of where you tell someone to take x steps ina one direction and y steps in another direction.
- There are many types of loops, but they all do the same thing essentially. **Repeat and action some number of times**

### Types of loops

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- labeled statement
- break statement
- continue statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement

## for statement

- A for loop repeats until a specificed condition evaluates to false. The JS for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

`(for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement)`

## while statement

- A while statement executes its statements as long as a specifid condition evaluates to 'true'. A while statement looks as follows.

`while (condition)
  statement`

## Arrays

- It is better to use a traditional for loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays.
