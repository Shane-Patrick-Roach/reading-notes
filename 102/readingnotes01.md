### Code

* When inserting code you must enclose it in backticks (`). This will be useful when talking about specific lines of code to others.

* To create a horizonal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes, or underscores on a line by themselves.

### Links

* To create a link, enclose the link text in a brackets and then follow it immediatley with the url in parantheses.

### Images

*To spice up the website with some cool visuals you can add them with the exclamation mark (!), followed by the path or URL to the image asset in parantheses.

### Escaping Characters

* If you dont want the specific characters to be rendered in the markdown language, add a backlash before the text. /(/)
