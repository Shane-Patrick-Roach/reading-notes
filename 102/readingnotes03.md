## What is Git?

- version control system
- lets multiple people work on it
- A history of changes
- ability to edit changes
- keeps all projects in one repository

## Good for keeping track

- each commit has a label that points to it
- **HEAD** : label meaning you are here

## What is github?

- not git
- allows sharing of code with others
- online place to store code (**back up**)
- manage teams work

## git + github = win

- git = version control
- github = online code storage

## Repositorys

- A repository is a collection of files that you told git to pay attention to

## Cloning a Git Repository

`git clone https://github.com/test`

## Check file status

`git status`

## Tracking and staging a new file

### Single file

`git add filename`

### All Files

`git add *`

## Committing a file

`git commit -m “made change x,y,z”`

## Committing All Changes
