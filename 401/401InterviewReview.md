### What are the features of Java Programming Language?

- Simple

- Portable - Works on the principle of read-once-write anywhere approach which can be executed in every machine.
- Platform independent - does not depend upon the operating system to execute the code as it comes with its own platform where its code is executed.
- Secured
- Robust
- Distributed

### Java is ALWAYS pass by value not reference.

This means that when ever you are trying to change something, you are identifying it with a specific value of where it is stored in memory, then accessing the object by that value.

- if changes are done to these variables, then only the instance will be affected. 
- local variables aare present within a block, function, or constructor and can be only accessed inside them.


### What is data encapsulation?

- Data encapsulation is an object oriented programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviors in a single unit.
- it helps developes follow modulaarity while developing siftware by enrusing that eaach object is independent of other objects by having its own methods, aattributes, and functionalities.

### What is the difference between equals() and equality operator (==) in Java?

#### Equals 
- Method defined in the object class
- used to check the equality of contents between two objects.

#### ==
- binary operator
