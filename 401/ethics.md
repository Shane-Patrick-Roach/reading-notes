## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and AI?

Technology is only engraining itself more and more into our society. Everything will eventually become in intelligent, in terms of smart phones, smart homes, smart cars, and smart cities. How then does this affect everyone and their individual world view? Is this slowly changing the the meaning of what it means to be human. What decisions are being made by you versus "fed to you by the algorithm"? Not to mention how does it make every individual feel that their privacy is virtually zero at this point?

We as a society need to ask very important questions on how best to integrate this technology into our world. The potential of it being used in a catastrophic manner is too high, some would argue that its worse than a nuclear weapon. The article mentions very good points in how we as a society may integrate technology in the best way possible. We need to ensure that our societies strike a healthy balance between business, government, and citizens. This requires everyone to be involved in the growth of a healthy, diverse, robust ecosystem. Since the future is filled with soo much novelety, we need to create a pluralistic society that is better able to cope with the range of unexpected challenges to come.

## Ethics of Self Driving Cars

---

This is a huge discussion in the tech world currently. How will self driving cars impact the world? More specifically, how will the algorithms that these vehicles use respond in given situations. Its aparent to me that this is an inevitable introduction into our society, and we really have to start questioning how these innovations integrate and impact our world rather than simply focusing on how to build them.

Lets focus on the ethical/behavioral domain first. Given the situation of a innevitable car accident that calculates/predicts a human fatality. Who will it choose to kill? Would it prioritize killing a child or elderly person? How does it make the decision? Do you choose to kill a person based off of their calculated value to society? How then do you calculate someones value to society? It is strictly in a utilitarian means? This is obviously a complex and nuanced problem, and is there even a correct answer? The thing to keep in mind is that these sort of problems spawn whenever you create new technology, and its probably more important to consider the ethical integration compared to the engineering.

I do find Germanys recently establish regulations on the behavioral models of self driving cars, "The proposed rules state that self-driving cars should always attempt to minimize human death and shouldn't discriminate between individuals based on age, gender or any other factor. Human lives should also always be given priority over animals or property". I beleive that this is a step in right direction, which could provide a solid base to integrating these types of innovations.

There are also all of the other problems that arise when you incorporate self driving cars into society that need to be addressed. Topics such as; freedom to not use a self driving car, changing infrastructure to account for less cars, changing peoples psychology around personally owning cars, etc.
