# AWS S3


## What is Amazon S3?
---

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
- Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.


## Concepts

- AWS Amplify storage module provides a simple mechanism for managing user content for your app in public, protected or private storage buckets.
- The storage category comes with built-in support for Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects within container buckets. An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file. To store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store to a bucket. When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata.
- Buckets are the containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. For each bucket, you can control access to it (who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket), view access logs for it and its objects, and choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents.
