# Serverless and Amplify

## What is Serverless?

---

- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.
- A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.


### Benefits of Serverless Architecture


#### For Marketing 
- The cost incurred by a serverless application is based on the number of function executions, measured in milliseconds instead of hours.
- Process agility: Smaller deployable units result in faster delivery of features to the market, increasing the ability to adapt to change.
- Cost of hiring backend infrastructure engineers goes down.
- Reduced operational costs


#### For developers

- Reduced liability, no backend infrastructure to be responsible for.
- Zero system administration.
- Easier operational management.
- Fosters adoption of Nanoservices, Microservices, SOA Principles.
- Faster set up.
- Scalable, no need to worry about the number of concurrent requests.
- Monitoring out of the box.
- Fosters innovation.

#### For users

- If businesses are using that competitive edge to ship features faster, then customers are receiving new features quicker than before.
- It is possible that users can more easily provide their own storage backend(i.e Dropbox, Google Drive).

### Drawbacks

#### For marketing

- Reduced overall control.
- Vendor lock-in requires more trust for a third-party provider.
- Additional exposure to risk requires more trust for a third party provider.
- Security risk.
- Disaster recovery risk
- Cost is unpredictable because the number of executions is not predefined
- All of these drawbacks can be mitigated with open-source alternatives but at the expense of cost benefits mentioned previously

#### For developers

- Immature technology results in component fragmentation, unclear best-practices.
- Architectural complexity.

#### For users

- Unless architected correctly, an app could provide a poor user experience as a result of increased request latency.
