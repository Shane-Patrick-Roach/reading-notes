# Notes on SQL

## What is SQL?

- SQL stands for **Structure Query Language**
- It is designed to allow both technical and non-technical manipulation of data-bases
- SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions 0f websites and mobile applications\
- There are many popular SQL databases including SQlite, MySQL, POSTgres, etc... Each of them can differ in additional features provided but all of them support the common SQL language standard.

## What is a relational Database?

- A relational database provides a common way to combine data.
- A collection of multiple two dimensional tables.

## What can we do with SQL?

- The goal of SQL is to learn how to answer specific questions about your data within a SQL database.

## What is the difference between SQL and no-SQL?

### Comes to choosing relational(SQL) or non-relational(no-SQL)

1. Language
2. Scalability
3. Structures

### Language

- relational databases defines and maniuplates data using SQL. Can be resturctive in many ways. All data must follow the same structure.
- dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, colum-oriented, graph-based or organized as KeyValue store. This felexibiity allows you to create a datastructure without having defined structure first.

### Scalability

- SQL is vertically scalable. You can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU, or SSD.
- noSQL are horizontally scalable meaning you can increase load by adding aditional servers.

### Structure

- SQL is table based
- NO-sql are key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide column stores.
