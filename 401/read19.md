# Functional Programming

## What is Functional Programming?

---

- In computer science it designates a programming paradigm.
- A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
- Forbidding state changes and mutable data.
- Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any globaal or local state.

## Data structures

- Purely functional daata structures are often represented in a different way thaan their imperative counterparts.

## Purley Functional language

- A purley functional language which only admits purley functional programming. 
- Purley functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purley functional.


## Things I want to know more about

---

### What is dynamic programming?

- a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub problems. Solving each sub problem.

### Overlapping subproblems

- A problem is said to have **overlaapping subproblems** if it can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

- Example: fibonacci sequence. 1,1,2,3,5,8

### Optimal Substructure

- A problem is said to have **optimal substructure** if an optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solution of its substructures.
- Example: Longest Simple Path
