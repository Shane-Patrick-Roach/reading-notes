## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
--- 

- Its really hard to narrow down what makes a good team work. Even if you fund a project with a massive amounts of money.
- Whats important when working in teams is that every person brings something unqiue and valuable. Everyone must be given room to speak and share ideas. To be heard.
- Creating a safe learning environment is key to success as a team. 


## How I explained REST to my brother

--- 

## Who is Roy Fielding?

- A guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet.
- An american computer scientist, one of the principal authors of HTTP specification.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- Each system interprets verbs differently and there was no standard reading. This is an issue when passing information from one system to another. 

- 
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- a protocol that is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP Get pn the URL you typed in and back comes a web page. 
- Http is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

### What does a GET do?
- allows each system to retrieve information from each other.

### What does a POST do?
- Used when one system needs to add information to another.

### What does PUT do?
- Used when one system needs to replace information in another.

### What does PATCH do?
- To partially replace information in another system.
