## What is a “component”?

#### Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions

- A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
- A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. 
- A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. 


### Views of a component

- Object-oriented
- Conventional 
- Process-related

## What are the charactistics of a component?

1. Reusability
2 Replaceable
3. Not context specific
4. Extensible
5. Encapsulated
6. Independent


## What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
- Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components. 


## What is “props” short for?

- "props" is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. 
- Special keyword in React




## How are props used in React?

1. Define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child components by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data

- Props are being passed to components like function arguments. 



## What is the flow of props?

- Unidirectional flow.
- Always from parent to child.
- We can keep passing data to each descendant.
- Props data is immutable (read only)

### What Is **React**?

- **React** is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
