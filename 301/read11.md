## nosql vs sql



### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

#### SQL	
- Primarily called Relationial Databases.
- Table based databases
- predefined schema
-SQL - structured query language, for defining and manipulating the data.
- SQL database examples: My sql, Oracle, sqlite, Postgres.





#### NoSQL
 	 
- Primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- document based, key-value pairs, graph or wide-column stores. 
- dynamic schema for unstructured data
- focused on collection of documents. Syntax varies from database to database.
- Example databases useing noSQL. MongoDB, Bigtable, Redis, RavenDB
 	 
 	 
### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- For complex querie intensive environements.
- SQL are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, on a single server.

### Give a real world example.

- Good use for banking, transaction processes.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- noSQL databases are a great fit for many modern applications such as mobile, web, and gaming that require flexible, scalable, high performance, and highly functional databases to provide great user experiences. 

### Give a real world example.

- Craigslist, new york times, online gaming. 

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- noSQL databases are highly preferred for large data sets.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

- I think it depends on what you are doing. Both can be scaled, but in different ways. SQL are verticalling scalable, while noSQL are horixontally scalable.
- Adding more processing power compared to adding more servers.


## Things I want to Know more about

---
### What is SQL? - Structured Query Language

- its a language that communicates with large databases
- Akin to hiring a tranlator who knows how to talk to databases. and she knows how to speak in the language of SQL. 
- So if you know how to speak in the language of sql, then you can have her go get files for you.
- ONly speaks toa Relational Databses
- Remember Sally sql
