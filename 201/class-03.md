From the Duckett JS book:

Review from 
Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)

Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
---

Three different types of lists.

- ordered, they use numbers
- unordered, they use bullets
- defintion lists, used to define terminology

Lists can also be nested inside one another.

## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

Remember that CSS treats each element as if it has its own BOX

- you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the box
- block level boxes can be made into block level boxes
- css3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### Arrays

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesnt just store one value. It stores a list of values.
- You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set values that are related to each other.
- you can create an array just like you would any other variable
- the array literal is preferred over the array constructor when creating arrays

### Values in Arrays

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero!


## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

---

### Switch statments
- start with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value

### Truthy and falsy values
- due to type coercion, every value in JS can be treated as if it were true or false, and this has some interesting side effects.
- a list can be found on page 167

### Loops

- loops check a condition. If it returns true. a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still true the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns a false. 

#### Types of loops

- For
- while
- do while

### For loop

- a for loop uses a counter as a condition. This will run a specific amount of times.
