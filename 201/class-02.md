### What is CSS

- the key to understanding CSS is to imagine there is an invisible box around every html element
- css allows you to create rules about how each box is presented
- you can use internal or external css

### Summary

- Rules are made up of selctors and declarations.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the elements that you want to change, and the values of those properties.
- Css usuallt appears in a different document but can be applied in the html file.

### Statements

- A script is a series if intructions that a computer can follow one by one. Each instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

### Comments

- You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
- // comment

### Variable

- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
- A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change each time the script runs.

### Datatypes

- numeric
- string
- boolean

### Arrays

- an array is a special type of variable. it doesnt just store one value. it stores a list of values

### Summary

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statment is like a step in a recipe
- Arrays are special types of variable that store more than one piece of related information.
- expressions evaluate into a single value.
- expressions rely on operators to calulate a value

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)

Looking a flowchart he code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. You have to tell the code which line of code should run next depending on the situation.

### Evaluating conditions and conditional statements

- there are two components to a decision. a = an expresion is evaluated, which reutrns a value. b = a conditional statment says what to do in a given situation

### Logical operators

- comparision operators usually return single values of true and false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparision operator.

### if statements

- the if statement evaluates a condition. if the condition evaluates to true, any staements in the subsequent code block are executed.

### if...else statements

- The if...else statement checks a condition.
If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resleves to false the second code block is run instead.
