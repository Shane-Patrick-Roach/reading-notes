- src: this tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will be a relative URL pointing to an image on your site
- alt: this proveides a text description of the image if you cannot see it
- title: can be used to provide additional information about the image.


### Where to place images:

- **Block** elements always appear on a new line
- **Inline** elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.
