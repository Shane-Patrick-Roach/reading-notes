## Introduction
---
### How the web works 
- when you connect to the web, you do so via an ISP (internet service provider)
- Your computer contacts a netwrok of servers called a DNS (Domain Name System).
- The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
- The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser


## HTML (Chapter 1) Structure 

- HTML describes the structure of pages 
- Html code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets - these are called html elements. 
- html elements are made up of an opening tag and a closing tag.
- **attributes** tell us more about the contents of an element.

### Summary of structure

- html pages are text documents
- tags are often referred to as elements
- opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the contents of that element.
- attributes require a name and a value

## HTML (Chapter 8) extra markup
---
### Doctypes

- Because there have been several versions of html, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE decleration to tell a browser which version of html the page is using.

### Comments
- comments can be made using `<!-- commment goes here -->`

### Information about your pages
- `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and contains information about that web page. It is not visble but is used for telling search engines about your page.

## Chapter 8 Summary

- Doctypes tell browsers which version of html you are using.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block level and inline elements together.
- `<ikframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of inforamtion about your webpage.

## HTML (Chapter 17) HTML5 Layout
---

- For a long time, web page authors used div elements to group together related elements on the page.
- Html5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of the page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web pages authors from using them already.

### Why is html5 better?

- The new elemnts provide clearer code (compared to ysing multiple div elements)
- Old browsers that do not understand html5 elements need to be told which elemnts are block level elements.
- To make html5 elements work in Internet explorer 8, or older versions, extra JS is needed.


## HTML (Chapter 18) Process and Design

---

- How to approach  building a site
- Understanding your audience amnd their needs
- How to present information visitors want to see.


### Who is the site for?

- Every website should be designed for the target audience--not just for yourself or the site owner.

#### Questions to ask yourself when approaching design

- what is the age range of you audience?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is their occupation?
- etc...

### SITE MAPS

- A site map will show how the flow of the website will be worked and which pages will be grouped together.
- remember to focus on the goals your user wants to acheive.

### Visual Hierarchy

- Most users dp not read pages. Rather they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key messages.
- Size
- Color
- Style

## Chapter 18 Summary

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. 
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present. 


## JS (Chapter 1) The abc of programming

---

### How does Javascript make web pages more interactive?

1. Access content
2. Modify content
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser

### What is a script and how do I make one?

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to acheive a goal. Akin to recipes, handbooks, manuals.
-



### Extra nots and fun things in JS

-In the JavaScript language (and most programming languages), we can use mathematical operators to calculate numbers and create expressions.
