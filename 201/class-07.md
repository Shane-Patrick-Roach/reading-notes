### What is domain modeling?

- Domain modelingin is the process of creating a concetual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors.
- An entity that stores data in properties an encapsualtes behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an **Object-oriented** model
- Used as a communication tool
- better unifies technical and business teams

Tips to follow when building domain models.
1. when modeling a single entity that has many instances, build self contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

4. For long tables you can split them up using thead, tbody, and tfoot.

### Constructor Notation, creating an object

- the ***new*** keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties and methods to the objects.
- to update values or properties, use dot notation or square brackets.

### Recap - ways to create objects

- Create object, then add properties and methods
- create an object with properties and methods

### Storing Data

- in JS, data is name/value pairs
- in arrays and objects the name is also known as a key

### global objects: String object

- whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the string object on that value.
- Each charcter in a string is automatically given a number, called an index number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one.
